Prof. Xuhua He comes to CUHK giving a talk toward the topic of AI4ADLV. I asked myself, will you be afraid of being replaced someday, that proofs in pure mathematics, can be proved using Computer science? Maybe not. Because I learn math out of my pure curiosity. If someday you don't love, then you find any things that you are interested in. That's life's entire meaning to me. 

btw，他像个诗人一样，穿着ADLV的衬衫，耀眼的让我想哭。真幸运。
