Hello! My name is FAN,Yuxin. I studied at [Shanghai University of Finance and Economics](https://www.sufe.edu.cn/) in the [School of Economics](https://econ.sufe.edu.cn/) from 2019 to 2023. After that, I moved to [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) to study mathematics. My research interest lies in inverse problems, statistics for PDEs and uncertainty qualification. Mathematics is the sunshine of my life.
