Hello! My name is FAN,Yuxin. I studied at [Shanghai University of Economics and Finance](https://www.sufe.edu.cn/) in the [School of Economics](https://econ.sufe.edu.cn/) from 2019-2023. After that, I move to [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) to study [mathematics](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/) from August 1st. My research interest lies in inverse problems, machine learning, Mathematical Statistics, statistics for PDEs and inverse problems.

You can find our group website here: [group website](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~btjin/). You can contact me by email: [Email](yxfan@math.cuhk.edu.hk).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
