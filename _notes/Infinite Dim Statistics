These notes are established followed by Nickl's book [Mathematical Foundations of Infinite-Dimensional Statistical Models](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/mathematical-foundations-of-infinitedimensional-statistical-models/92CAE4193AEA7143CF974296FA8B81E9). I learned this stuff in the first graduate semester.
